#Modeling Anomalous Diffusion in Crowded Cellular Environments: Simulation Notebook

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook that accompanies the paper **"Modeling Anomalous Diffusion in Crowded Cellular Environments"**

The notebook simulates particle motion in crowded cellular environments to explore how crowding leads to anomalous diffusion.
