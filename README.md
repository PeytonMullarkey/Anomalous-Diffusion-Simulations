This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook that accompanies the paper **"Modeling Anomalous Diffusion in Crowded Cellular Environments"**

The notebook simulates particle motion in crowded cellular environments to explore how crowding leads to anomalous diffusion. The code has tunable parameters for particle number, crowding, simulation length, and step size.
