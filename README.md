This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook that accompanies the paper **"Modeling Anomalous Diffusion in Crowded Cellular Environments"**

The notebook simulates particle motion in crowded cellular environments to explore how crowding leads to anomalous diffusion. The code has tunable parameters including grid size, crowding density, obstacle sizes, simulation steps, and number of runs.‚Äù
